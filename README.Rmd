# diagMutAnalysis
R package that analyzes ICGC data for BCB410H: Applied Bioinformatics

<!-- badges: start -->

## Description
`diagMutAnalysis` is an R package that takes data formats curated same as the ICGC DCC open database. By taking their excellently curated browser and using it as a motif for a R package. The aim of the package is to re-create the ICGC database analysis in a user friendly R package and also analyze different aspects they have not handled [Zhang J et al.].The package provides a function on analyzing somatic mutation sample donors by producing values such as the proportion and frequency of all gene mutations that has had an effect. Another function creates plots not existing in the ICGC database as a different perspective to the data. Providing information on frequency and types of cds mutations, and mutation consequence types in a bar plot and pie chart of respective order. To find information on how the data used in the functions should be formatted refer to the vignettes. Developed on `R version 4.1.0 (2021-05-18)`,`platform x86_64-w64-mingw32`, and `Running under: Windows`.

## Installation

To install the latest version of the package:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
require("devtools")
devtools::install_github("wjdwogud24/diagMutAnalysis", build_vignettes = TRUE)
library("diagMutAnalysis")
```
To run the Shiny app:
```r
rundiagMutAnalysis()
```

## Overview
``` r
ls("package:diagMutAnalysis")
data(package = "diagMutAnalysis") 
browseVignettes("diagMutAnalysis")
```
`diagMutAnalysis` contains 2 functions that demonstrate analysis on ICGC open data. The mutationPercentage function aims to analyze gene mutation in the sample donors.Aim is to get proportion of all gene mutation's that have effected the sample donors. mutationTypePlot creates two plots a bar plot and a pie chart. Bar plot shows information on substitution types in the sample. Pie chart gives information on mutation consequence types in the sample.

## Contributions
The package is created by the author Jae Hyung Jung. `Ggplot2`[H.Wickham], `dplyr`[H.Wickham et al.], `stringr`[H.Wickham] package is used several times throughout functions. `mutationPercentage` and `mutationTypePlot` uses `dplyr` packages extensively for data manipulation. `Ggplot2` to create bar plots and pie charts for `mutationTypePlot`. `Stringr` package to extract specific strings in data for `mutationTypePlot`. The references are provided. Thought process of developing analysis is influenced by ICGC database[Zhang et al.]. Analysis not done in ICGC that are only solely in this package are created using Author's intuition on what is useful for the ICGC data.
